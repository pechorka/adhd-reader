But when an explicit statement declares what problem needs to be solved, every effort is focused on that single outcome.

A well-framed product design problem statement that is documented as part of a product design brief is a simple tool to weigh options and measure success. A good design problem statement will leave room for creativity, but it ultimately provides a clear lens through which to view each element of the project.

Outlining the problem statement and the design process steps acts as a filter that sifts out superfluous or irrelevant ideas and retains only the ones that meet the need.

The Four Ws: Questions to Answer
Ideally, this is a method that gathers key stakeholders around a pile of Post-its and a large wall. By asking four simple questions, everyone can put their own thoughts up and together synthesize the content to find focus and clarity.

Who is affected? Who is experiencing the problem? Can this user be further specified (by demographic, persona, motivation, reason for being in the situation)?
What is the problem? What are the struggles? What task needs to be accomplished?

What pain point needs to be relieved?
Where does it happen? What is the context in which the user experiences the problem? Is it in a physical or digital space? Who else is involved?
Why does it matter? Why is this problem worth solving? What value does it bring to the user? What value does it bring to the business?
Empathy Map: Putting Yourself in the User’s Shoes
Empathy maps are a common tool used in UX design and can be helpful in many stages throughout a product’s development. Here, at the start, it instantly connects the team to the user to find out what their purpose might be.

Depending on the amount of time you have for the problem framing stage, this method can involve user interviews and observational shadowing.Hear and see. What kind of comments or concepts does the user encounter? What are others saying that the user is exposed to? What does the user observe others doing around them? (This category illustrates the user’s surroundings.)
Say and do. What are the user’s comments and behaviors? What are they saying out loud to others? What do they do in practice?

(These are things that are explicitly done and can be clearly observed.)
Think and feel. What does the user think but keep to themself? How do they emotionally react to a situation? What are their desires? (These aren’t always apparent by simply observing a user, but can be revealed through conversational interviews. It takes some digging to understand what is happening on a subconscious level, but this is where great insights can be found.)
Pains and gains. What frustrations does the user have? What about the experience is unnecessary or disappointing? In contrast, what about the experience is improving the life of the user? What works well? Where or when is the user happiest? (These are the outcomes of the experience.)https://prnt.sc/gg8j9XIaZ1iI
The Final Problem Statement
This is a simple but really effective way to bring focus to the insights you’ve uncovered and the ultimate problem you can frame.

The design problem statement structure template is like a page from MadLibs, a sentence with blank spaces to fill with your insights. It creates a concise statement rooted in your team’s collective thinking. It’s important to keep the statement specific enough so there is a shared vision for the product, but broad enough to allow for creativity and new insights.

Here are a few design problem statement example formats:

From the point of view of the user: “I am (persona) trying to (verb) but (barrier) because (cause) which makes me feel (emotional reaction).”
e.g., “I am a new mum trying to take care of my baby in the best way possible, but I don’t know if I’m doing a good job because I’m always at home alone and don’t have anyone to talk to about it, which makes me feel isolated and alone.”
Drawn from user research: “(Persona) needs a way to (user’s need) because (insight).

”
e.g., “New mums need a way to connect with other mums because they are often at home alone during the day and feel isolated and alone.”
Using the 4 Ws: “Our (who) has the problem that (what) when (where). Our solution should deliver (why).”
e.g., “Our new mum has the problem that she has no one to talk to about the best way to care for her baby when she is at home alone every day. Our solution should deliver a way for her to feel connected to other mums so she feels less isolated and alone.

Every Good Problem Framing Phase, No Matter How Simple, Should:
Avoid proposing solutions. It’s easy to think in the tangible terms of features and functionality, but these will only distract from first understanding the fundamental problem.
Ask why. It’s a simple question to help find insights under the surface. But as Fast Company contributor Tina Seelig writes, asking “why” lets you see a situation from a different angle.
Reflect. Make time to step back and look for connections and patterns. This is where insights lie that can set a product apart from competitors.
Keep it universal. Avoid using jargon or any unnecessary complexities. The problem should be simple for anyone to understand, and ideally, to retell. Equipping team members to easily talk about what you are trying to achieve will build confidence and passion within the project.
Forget the Horse, Deliver a Car
What is a design problem statement? Some clients may set a brief that clearly defines the problem to solve. Others might not know about this crucial stage. Therein lies an opportunity for you to lead the client in taking a step back and evaluating why this product will exist. Together you can align the team, craft a framework, and kick off an effective and efficient process.Perhaps the greatest value of this step is understanding the human psyche. Framing a problem from a customer’s perspective lets you more effectively deliver what people never knew they needed.
